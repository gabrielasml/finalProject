      <h3> The LGBTQ+ minority is one of the most discriminated minorities to ever exist. LGBTQ+
        youth are 62% more likely to commit suicide,do drugs,be exploited, or be sexually abused.
        LGBTQ+ youth are also bullied and discriminated in school and work, but only 1/2 of all the states
        have any laws against it. There has also been studies showing that 20% of LGBTQ+
        believe that they have experienced unfair treatment in job interviews making
        life much harder for them. This stops now! </h3>

        <h3> Women and transgender individuals are also heavily discriminated against.
        A study in 2017 showed that women make a average of $770 per week and
        men make about $941 per week. This is because of stereotypes putting women in lower
        paying jobs and because of the wage gap. Women earn aproximately 80% of what men earn
        even if theyre in the same job.
        A study suggests that transgender adults in the U.S. are 4 times more likely to
        have a income of less than 10,000 per year when compared the general population.
        Another suggests that 90% of transgender people have been harassed or put down
        because of theyre identity. Gender discrimination needs to be stopped.</h3>

      <h3> Minorities are a group of people who expereince disadvantages as compared to
        the general population. Minorities also often suffer discrimination in they're everyday life. Minorities
        are based on ethnicity, race, religeon, sexual orientation, disabilities, and gender identity.
        Minorities deserve equality,  participation in political rights, and safety/protection
        from discrimination.</h3>
