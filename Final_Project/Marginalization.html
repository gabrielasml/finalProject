          <div class="cry">

              <p class="Info">People use socioeconomic data to gathered and analyzed by the federal, state, and local governments to determine everything ranging from tax rates to political representation. Nongovernmental organizations and institutions as well, even Google. However, when on the topic of socioeconomics it usually relates to social studies as this looks at income, education, and occupation to determine one’s socioeconomic status (SES). This of course does not completely define a person but it gives much insight to the physical and mental health of those in each SES, as well as their general health and welfare. Those who had a lower SES were more likely to be at risk to poor health, behavioral and development issues, obesity, infant mortality, suicide, and even crime rates and poverty. There are more of those who are in have a lower SES compared to those who hold a high SES, which also happens to be white people holding those higher statuses.</p>

              <p class="Info">The term racial minority is a noun that refers to a group of people of a certain race that are the minority compared to a larger group of people, or population, of another race. By the beginning of the 20th century in America the population consisted of 87% white people while the other 13% consisted of everyone else. Here, we have our majority population, the bigger group of people. One of our most well known minority group consists of African-Americans and the Latino community. 39% and 33% of children and adolescents of African-Americans and Latino respectively have live in poverty, double non-Latino, White, and Asian children and adolescents which is 14%. However, while Asian American families are marked above the poverty line, this is also due to 4-5 people working full time in one household. This also affects the minority groups, health as they are more prone to preventable diseases compared to the majority. Not only that, but the insurance coverage does not cover as much the coverage that the majority games. This is especially harmful to Hispanics and American Indians as they are less likely to have these coverages pre-retirement.</p>
